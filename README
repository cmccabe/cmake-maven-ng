The CMake build system is often used to build C and C++ code.  Cmake Maven NG
is a Maven plugin which allows Maven to invoke CMake as part of the build.

CMake Maven NG has many advantages:
* Works with Java 6 and later
* Prints compiler warning messages to the Maven stdout
* Supports native test execution with "mvn test -Dtest="
* Save the native test error codes, stdout, and stderr to files for later
inspection.
* Doesn't rely on the shell, so it is impervious to shell metacharacter issues
and differing shell versions.
* Supports "mvn clean"

Currently CMake Maven NG has been tested with GCC on Linux.  We plan to support
other platforms in the future, including Windows.
